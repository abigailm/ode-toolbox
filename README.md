# ode-toolbox

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/nest/ode-toolbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nest/ode-toolbox) [![Testing coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/nest/ode-toolbox/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/nest/ode-toolbox)

Choosing the optimal solver for systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a critical step in dynamical systems simulation. ode-toolbox assists in solver benchmarking, and recommends solvers on the basis of a set of user-configurable heuristics. For all dynamical equations that admit an analytic solution, ode-toolbox generates propagator matrices that allow the solution to be calculated at machine precision.

ode-toolbox is written in Python and leverages SymPy for the symbolic manipulation of equations. It was initially developed in the context of the [NESTML](https://github.com/nest/nestml) project, in which the main focus was on the class of spiking neurons presently available in the [NEST](https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator) simulator. It can, however, be used standalone and is broadly applicable to continuous-time dynamical systems as well as systems that undergo instantaneous events (such as neuronal spikes or impulsive forces).


## Installation

### Prerequisites

ode-toolbox depends on the Python packages SymPy, SciPy and NumPy and (optionally) matplotlib and graphviz for visualisation, and pytest for self-tests. The stiffness tester additionally depends on an installation of [PyGSL](http://pygsl.sourceforge.net/). If PyGSL is not installed, the test for stiffness is skipped during the analysis of the equations.

The required packages can be installed by running 

```
pip install sympy scipy numpy pygsl
```


### Installing ode-toolbox

To install, clone the repository, go to the root directory and then run the following commands in a terminal:

```
python setup.py install
```

If you wish to install ode-toolbox into your home directory, add the option `--user` to the above call.

For further installation hints, please see [.travis.yml](.travis.yml).


### Testing

To run the unit and integration tests that come with ode-toolbox, you can run the following command:

```
python -m pytest
```

Please note that this requires the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) package to be installed.

To increase the verbosity, append the command-line parameters `-s -o log_cli=true -o log_cli_level="DEBUG"`.


## Usage

ode-toolbox can be used in two ways:
1. As a Python module. Import the `odetoolbox` module, and then call `odetoolbox.analysis(indict)` where `indict` is the JSON-like input in Python dictionary format. See the tests (e.g. [test_lorenz_attractor.py](tests/test_lorenz_attractor.py)) for an example.
2. As command line application. In this case, the input is stored in a JSON file, and ode-toolbox is invoked from the command line as `ode_analyzer.py my_model.json`

The JSON file and Python dictionary are completely equivalent in content and form, described in the "Input" section below.


## Analytic solver selection criteria

If an ODE is homogeneous and linear, an analytic solution can be computed. Analytically solvable ODEs can also contain dependencies on other analyically solvable ODEs, but an otherwise analytically tractable ODE cannot depend on an ODE that can only be solved numerically. In the latter case, no analytic solution will be computed.

For example, consider an integrate-and-fire neuron with three postsynaptic currents: excitatory, inhibitory and gap junction. The inhibitory kernel is nonlinear, whereas the other kernels and membrane potential are homogeneous and linear, and thereby analytically solvable. First, a dependency graph is generated, where each node corresponds to one dynamical variable, and an arrow from node *a* to *b* indicates that *a* depends on the value of *b*. In addition, each variable is labeled according to whether it can be analytically solved, indicated by a green colour:

![Dependency graph with membrane potential and excitatory and gap junction kernels marked green](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clinssen/ode-toolbox/merge_shape_ode_concepts-dev/doc/fig/eq_analysis_1.png)

Second, variables are unmarked as analytically solvable if they depend on other variables that are themselves not analytically solvable. In this example, `V_abs` is unmarked as it depends on the nonlinear excitatory kernel:

![Dependency graph with excitatory and gap junction kernels marked green](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clinssen/ode-toolbox/merge_shape_ode_concepts-dev/doc/fig/eq_analysis_2.png)

The analytic solution is computed in the form of a propagator matrix.

## Numeric solver selection criteria

Solver selection is performed on the basis of a set of rules, defined in `StiffnessTester.draw_decision()`. The logic is as follows:

 * If the minimum step size recommended by all solvers is smaller than `machine_precision_dist_ratio` times the machine precision, a warning is issued.
 * If the minimum step size for the implicit solver is smaller than `machine_precision_dist_ratio` times the machine precision, recommend the explicit solver.
 * If the minimum step size for the explicit solver is smaller than `machine_precision_dist_ratio` times the machine precision, recommend the implicit solver.
 * If the average step size for the implicit solver is at least `avg_step_size_ratio` times as large as the average step size for the explicit solver, recommend the implicit solver.
 * Otherwise, recommend the explicit solver.


| Name        | Default           | Description  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `avg_step_size_ratio` | 6 | Ratio between average step sizes of implicit and explicit solver. Larger means that the explicit solver is more likely to be selected. |
| `machine_precision_dist_ratio` | 10 | Disqualify a solver if its minimum step size comes closer than this ratio to the machine precision. |


## Input

The JSON input dictionary that is passed to ode-toolbox contains **dynamics**, **numerical parameters**, and **options**. **Documentation** may optionally be provided as a string.

All expressions are parsed as sympy expressions. There are several predefined symbols, such as `e` and `E` for Euler's number, trigonometric functions, etc. The list of predefined symbols is defined in `symbols.py`, as the static member `Shape._sympy_globals`. Variable names should be chosen such that they do not overlap with the predefined symbols.


### Dynamics

All dynamical variables have a variable name, a differential order, and a defining expression. The overall dynamics is given as a list of these definitions. For example, we can define an alpha shape kernel :math:`g` with time constant :math:`\tau` as follows:

```Python
"dynamics":
[
    {
        "expression": "g'' = -1 / tau**2 * g - 2/tau * g'"
    }
]
```

Instead of a second-order differential equation, we can equivalently describe the kernel shape as a function of time:

```Python
"dynamics":
[
    {
        "expression": "g = (e / tau) * t * exp(-t / tau)"
    }
]
```

Expressions can refer to variables defined in other expressions. For example, a third equivalent formulation of the alpha shape is as the following system of two coupled first-order equations:

```Python
"dynamics":
[
    {
        "expression": "g' = h",
    },
    {
        "expression": "h' = -g / tau**2 - 2 * h / tau",
    }
]
```


### Initial values

As many initial values have to be specified as the differential order requires, that is, none for functions of time, one for a one-dimensional system of ODEs, and so on. Continuing the second-order alpha function example:

```Python
"dynamics":
[
    {
        "expression": "g'' = -1 / tau**2 * g - 2/tau * g'"
        "initial_values":
        {
            "g" : "0",
            "g'" : "e / tau"
        }
    }
]
```

If only one initial value is required, the following simpler syntax may be used, which omits the variable name:

```Python
"dynamics":
[
    {
        "expression": "g' = -g / tau"
        "initial_value": "e / tau"
    }
]
```

### Parameters

It is not necessary to supply numerical values for the parameters (e.g. `tau = 10E-3`). The expressions are symbolically analysed, and in this case a set of propagators will be generated, because the alpha kernel is analytically tractable. However, in some cases (in particular when doing stiffness testing), it can be important to simulate with a particular set of parameter values. In this case, they can be specified in the global `parameters` dictionary. This dictionary maps parameter names to default values, for example:


```Python
"parameters":
{
    "C_m": ".4",
    "E_K": "-70",
    "E_L": "-50",
    "I_ext": "30E-3"
}
```

### Options

Further options for the integrator, decision criteria for solver selection and so on, can be specified in the global `options` dictionary, for example:

```Python
"options" : {
    "output_timestep_symbol": "__h"
    "sim_time": "100E-3",
    "max_step_size": ".25E-3",
    "integration_accuracy" : "1E-9"
}
```

## Output

The analysis output is returned in the form of a Python dictionary, or an equivalent JSON file.

During analysis, ode-toolbox rewrites the differential notation from single quotation marks into characters that are typically compatible with variable names; by default every quotation mark is rewritten into the string "__d".

TODO: JSON format overview
ode-toolbox will return a list of solvers. Each solver has the following keys:
- `state_variables`: an unordered list containing all variable symbols.
- `initial_values`: a dictionary that maps each variable symbol (in string form) to a sympy expression. For example `"g" : "e / tau"`.
- `parameters`: only present when parameters were supplied in the input. The input parameters are copied into the output for convenience.
- `solver`: a string containing the solver recommendation. Either "analytical" or "numeric".


Analytic solvers have the following extra entries:

- `update_expressions` : a dictionary that maps each variable symbol (in string form) to a sympy propagator expression. The interpretation of an entry `"g" : "g * __P__g__g + h * __P__g__h"` is that, at each integration timestep, when the state of the system needs to be updated from the current time :math:`t` to the next step :math:`t + \Delta t`, we assign the new value `"g * __P__g__g + h * __P__g__h"` to the variable `g`. Note that the expression is always evaluated at the old time :math:`t`; this means that when more than one state variable needs to be updated, all of the expressions have to be calculated before updating any of the variables.

- `propagators` : a dictionary that maps each propagator matrix entry to its defining expression; for example `"__P__g__h" : "__h*exp(-__h/tau)"`


Numeric solvers have the following extra entries:
- `update_expressions`: a dictionary that maps each variable symbol (in string form) to a sympy expression that is its Jacobian, that is, for a symbol :math:`x`, the expression is equal to :math:`\frac{\delta x}{\delta t}`.
